Used React Js form for the submissions, and implemented jQuery to make a network request to Agify.io with the name the user entered. Parsed the response from the endpoint and display the predicted age of the user.

## Features

The agify predictor mainly focuses on :
- Keep track of the predicted ages for each name so you only have to make a request once for each name.
- Parse the response from the endpoint and display the predicted age of the user.


## Tech & API

- [React Js]([https://flutter.dev/docs](https://react.dev/))
- [jQuery]([https://firebase.google.com/docs](https://jquery.com/))
- [Agify.io](https://agify.io/documentation#basic-usage)


## Deployment

I have deployed the project on the Vercel.
